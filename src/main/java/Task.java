        1. Automate two test cases from each module that you wrote for the previous homework.

        2. Write a program that will open five different pages in new windows:

        http://www.automationpractice.pl/index.php

        https://zoo.waw.pl/

        https://www.w3schools.com/

        https://www.clickspeedtester.com/click-counter/

        https://andersenlab.com/

        Write a loop that will sequentially switch between all the pages, printing the title and link of each page to the console.

        Close the page that contains the word "Zoo" in the title.

        3. Write a method that accepts two WebElements as parameters.

                The method will print to the console which of the two elements is positioned higher on the page, which is positioned to the left, and which element takes up more space.

        The method parameters may include additional arguments if necessary.

        4. Write a script that opens a browser and logs in an already registered user on the QA Course 01 (andersenlab.com).

        5. Write a program that replicates the actions in the video "Scenario for Automation Lecture 15.mp4".
